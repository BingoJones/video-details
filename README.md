# A refactoring of an Internet Archive video details page in VueJS.

## Installation
```
yarn install
```

### Run app
```
yarn serve
```

Open up [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you'll see the video details page for InformationM.
To view other videos, just change the url (e.g., [http://localhost:8080/AboutBan1935](http://localhost:8080/AboutBan1935) or [http://localhost:8080/EatforHe1945](http://localhost:8080/EatforHe1945));

If you try to look up a topic that has no videos, then an error message will be shown.  For example: [http://localhost:8080/naruto](http://localhost:8080/naruto).
